# Artifact Classification

This document is the authoritative source for how every artifact in the SDD standard is classified across the four-layer architecture.

Use this table to decide: should a new artifact be in the baseline, a profile, or a local pack?

## Decision Table

## Support-Level Taxonomy

Use these labels consistently across docs:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Guaranteed** | Baseline sync installs, creates, or merges the artifact consistently as part of the repo contract. |
| **Supported** | The standard can work with the artifact or tool, but some behavior depends on runtime or local setup. |
| **Recommended** | Suggested by the workflow design, but not technically enforced by baseline sync. |
| **Local-only** | Must stay in developer-local config and is never committed by baseline sync. |
| **Experimental** | Mentioned or scaffolded, but not yet first-class in the stable standard. |

## Classification Rules

### A new artifact belongs in Layer 2 (baseline) if:
- It defines the SDD delivery contract for the whole team
- It must be consistent across all repos
- It has no dependency on local services or personal credentials
- Its absence would break the SDD workflow

### A new artifact belongs in Layer 3 (profile) if:
- It extends the contract for a specific class of repos
- Not all repos need it
- It is a team decision, not an individual developer preference
- Its absence does not break baseline SDD workflow

### A new artifact belongs in Layer 4 (local only) if:
- It requires local services (AIRIS Gateway, browser engines)
- It carries or references credentials
- It is specific to one developer's environment
- Its presence in a committed file would break other developers' setups

## When in doubt

Ask: "Would committing this file cause problems for a developer who doesn't have AIRIS running, doesn't have a Morph API key, or is using a different AI tool than the one this config targets?"

If yes → Layer 4 (local only).
